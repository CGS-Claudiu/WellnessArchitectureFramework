                <h1>The Importance of Energy Management</h1>
                <p>Managing energy effectively is essential for maintaining productivity and avoiding burnout. Incorporating rest intervals into your day helps refresh focus, improve mental clarity, and preserve energy for sustained performance.</p>

                <h1>Effective Rest Interval Techniques</h1>
                <p>Using strategic rest techniques can help you maximize productivity while maintaining well-being. Here are some proven methods to incorporate into your daily routine:</p>

                <!-- Pomodoro Technique -->
                <h3>Pomodoro Technique</h3>
                <p>Work for a set period, typically 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. This approach promotes focus during work intervals and allows brief rest to recharge. After four cycles, take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. <a href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique" target="_blank">Learn more about the Pomodoro Technique</a></p>

                <!-- 90-Minute Work Cycle -->
                <h3>90-Minute Work Cycle</h3>
                <p>Following our natural ultradian rhythm, work for 90 minutes and then take a 15-20 minute break. This longer interval supports deep work and minimizes cognitive fatigue. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/199403/renewal-rhythm" target="_blank">Read about the 90-minute rhythm cycle</a></p>

                <!-- Microbreaks for Quick Refreshing -->
                <h3>Microbreaks for Quick Refreshing</h3>
                <p>Take short, 1-2 minute breaks every 20-30 minutes. These brief pauses prevent mental fatigue and help maintain focus throughout the day.</p>

                <!-- Physical Activity Breaks -->
                <h3>Physical Activity Breaks</h3>
                <p>Incorporate movement into breaks by stretching, walking, or doing light exercises. Physical activity boosts energy and improves circulation, reducing feelings of lethargy.</p>

                <!-- Mindfulness and Breathing Exercises -->
                <h3>Mindfulness and Breathing Exercises</h3>
                <p>Use breaks to practice mindfulness or deep breathing exercises. These activities reduce stress, clear the mind, and enhance focus when returning to tasks. <a href="https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/" target="_blank">Explore mindfulness practices</a></p>

                <!-- Setting Boundaries for Rest Intervals -->
                <h3>Setting Boundaries for Rest Intervals</h3>
                <p>Establish clear boundaries during rest intervals to avoid interruptions, allowing for true relaxation and energy restoration.</p>

                <!-- Conclusion -->
                <h3>Preserving Energy Through Strategic Breaks</h3>
                <p>Integrating rest intervals throughout your day is a proactive way to manage energy and productivity. By prioritizing breaks, you can enhance focus, prevent burnout, and sustain a balanced and effective work routine.</p>
