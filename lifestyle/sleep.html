                <h2>Key Components of Effective Sleep Hygiene</h2>

                <h3>Consistent Sleep Schedule</h3>
                <p>Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day regulates your body's internal clock, leading to better sleep quality.</p>

                <h3>Creating a Relaxing Environment</h3>
                <p>Optimize your sleep space by keeping it cool, dark, and quiet. Consider blackout curtains, a sound machine, or a fan to create a restful atmosphere.</p>

                <h3>Limiting Screen Time Before Bed</h3>
                <p>Avoid screens at least an hour before bed to reduce blue light exposure, which can interfere with melatonin production and disrupt sleep.</p>

                <h3>Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques</h3>
                <p>Engage in calming activities like reading, meditation, or deep breathing exercises to ease the mind and prepare for sleep.</p>

                <h3>Avoiding Caffeine and Heavy Meals in the Evening</h3>
                <p>Limit caffeine intake after the afternoon and avoid heavy meals close to bedtime to support a more restful sleep experience.</p>
