Adding plants not only enhances aesthetics but also creates a more refreshing and calming atmosphere. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/air-purifying-plants" target="_blank">Discover the benefits of air-purifying plants</a></p>

                <!-- Using Non-Toxic Cleaning Products -->
                <h3>Using Non-Toxic Cleaning Products</h3>
                <p>Switch to eco-friendly, non-toxic cleaning supplies to reduce exposure to harmful chemicals. Many natural cleaning products are effective and support both personal health and environmental sustainability.</p>

                <!-- Decluttering Regularly for Mental Clarity -->
                <h3>Decluttering Regularly for Mental Clarity</h3>
                <p>A clutter-free space promotes mental clarity and reduces stress. Regularly sort through belongings, organize spaces, and keep only items that add value to your life. Decluttering creates a sense of order and calm, essential for a healthy living environment.</p>

                <!-- Prioritizing Good Ventilation -->
                <h3>Prioritizing Good Ventilation</h3>
