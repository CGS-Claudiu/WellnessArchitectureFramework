                <h1>Why Self-Esteem Matters</h1>
                <p>Self-esteem is the foundation of how you view yourself and your place in the world. It influences your confidence, decision-making, relationships, and resilience in challenging situations. Cultivating self-esteem creates the emotional stability needed for self-awareness and personal growth.</p>

                <h1>The Connection Between Self-Esteem and Self-Awareness</h1>
                <p>Self-awareness is the ability to understand your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, while self-esteem is how you value yourself within that understanding. Together, they form a feedback loop: increased self-awareness improves self-esteem, and a healthy self-esteem enables deeper self-reflection.</p>
