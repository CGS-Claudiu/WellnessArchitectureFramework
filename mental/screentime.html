                <h1>The Importance of Digital Wellness</h1>
                <p>With increased digital engagement, practicing digital wellness is essential for mental clarity and emotional well-being. Limiting screen time helps reduce stress and fosters a more balanced lifestyle.</p>

                <h1>Strategies for Digital Wellness and Limiting Screen Time</h1>
                <p>Adopting mindful screen time habits can improve focus, enhance relationships, and support mental health. Here are some effective strategies to maintain digital wellness:</p>

                <!-- Setting Screen Time Limits -->
                <h3>Setting Screen Time Limits</h3>
                <p>Use device settings or apps to set daily screen time limits. This practice encourages mindful use and prevents excessive screen exposure. </p>

                <!-- Establishing “Tech-Free” Times and Zones -->
                <h3>Establishing “Tech-Free” Times and Zones</h3>
                <p>Create tech-free periods during meals, mornings, or evenings to stay present and promote meaningful connections. Consider setting up tech-free zones, like the bedroom, for better mental balance.</p>

                <!-- Practicing the 20-20-20 Rule -->
                <h3>Practicing the 20-20-20 Rule</h3>
                <p>Reduce eye strain and mental fatigue by following the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and focus on something 20 feet away.</p>

                <!-- Limiting Social Media Use -->
                <h3>Limiting Social Media Use</h3>
                <p>Minimize time spent on social media by setting daily usage goals or limiting access during certain times. This practice reduces stress and enhances focus.</p>

                <!-- Practicing Mindful Device Use -->
                <h3>Practicing Mindful Device Use</h3>
                <p>Engage with digital devices intentionally by focusing on one task at a time. Avoid multitasking with screens to improve concentration and mental clarity.</p>

                <!-- Prioritizing Offline Activities -->
                <h3>Prioritizing Offline Activities</h3>
                <p>Spend more time on offline activities like reading, exercising, or hobbies. Replacing screen time with offline pursuits supports a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.</p>
