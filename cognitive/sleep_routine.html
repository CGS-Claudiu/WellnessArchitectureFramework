                <h1>The Importance of Sleep Hygiene</h1>
                <p>Good sleep hygiene is essential for cognitive performance, emotional resilience, and overall energy. Establishing consistent and healthy sleep habits can improve memory, focus, and physical well-being, helping you feel refreshed each day.</p>

                <h1>Tips for Optimizing Sleep Hygiene</h1>
                <p>Here are some practical steps you can take to optimize sleep hygiene and support a restful night:</p>

                <!-- Creating a Consistent Sleep Schedule -->
                <h3>Creating a Consistent Sleep Schedule</h3>
                <p>Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, even on weekends. A consistent schedule helps regulate your body’s internal clock, making it easier to fall asleep and wake up refreshed. <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene" target="_blank">Explore tips on creating a sleep routine</a></p>

                <!-- Reducing Blue Light Exposure Before Bed -->
                <h3>Reducing Blue Light Exposure Before Bed</h3>
                <p>Avoid screens, like phones and laptops, for at least an hour before bed. Blue light disrupts melatonin production, which can interfere with falling asleep. Consider using blue light filters if screen time is necessary.</p>

                <!-- Creating a Relaxing Pre-Sleep Routine -->
                <h3>Creating a Relaxing Pre-Sleep Routine</h3>
                <p>Engage in relaxing activities, such as reading, stretching, or practicing meditation, to signal to your body that it’s time to wind down. This routine promotes relaxation and prepares you for restful sleep. <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-create-a-relaxing-bedtime-routine-3144684" target="_blank">Learn about bedtime relaxation routines</a></p>

                <!-- Optimizing Your Sleep Environment -->
                <h3>Optimizing Your Sleep Environment</h3>
                <p>Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet. Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows, and remove distractions to create an environment conducive to sleep.</p>

                <!-- Limiting Caffeine and Alcohol Intake -->
                <h3>Limiting Caffeine and Alcohol Intake</h3>
                <p>Avoid caffeine in the late afternoon and limit alcohol close to bedtime. Both substances can disrupt sleep quality, affecting how rested you feel in the morning.</p>

                <!-- Practicing Mindful Breathing for Relaxation -->
                <h3>Practicing Mindful Breathing for Relaxation</h3>
                <p>Use breathing exercises, such as 4-7-8 breathing, to help relax your mind and body before sleep. Mindful breathing promotes calmness and prepares you for rest. <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedtime-breathing-exercises" target="_blank">Explore bedtime breathing exercises</a></p>

                <!-- Conclusion -->
                <h3>Supporting Cognitive Health Through Quality Sleep</h3>
                <p>Optimizing sleep hygiene is a powerful way to enhance cognitive function, mental energy, and resilience. By prioritizing restful sleep, you create a foundation for greater clarity, focus, and well-being each day.</p>
